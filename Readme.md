## Project description


A description for an application used by the Human Rescourses Department when implement new hiring strategies.
This application has been made with the idea of making it easier for companies to know when and how to hire new employees when needed.
We aim to make an application that will give a simple, yet effective way for how companies deal with hiring new staff when needed and to simplify the steps of the different departments that need new employees.
This will contain a Super Admin, which notifies HR that a new employee is needed for a certain Department.
An HR Department which will post notices of employment, and receive thru the program their application.
A Finance department which will be managing the salaries and the contracts with the employees.
A Employee which will send in an application with the needed documents, will be signing a Contract with an Electronic Signature, wil be payed a salary from the Finance Department, and will be made part of a Department, all of this will be in their own profile for safe keeping, which they will have acces to this.(Read Mode Only)
(The Employee will have acces to his own Profile which shows all the Hours Of Work for that Month, the time since they have started working and also the salaries that they have been payed, and the one they are to be payed at the end of the month.)
